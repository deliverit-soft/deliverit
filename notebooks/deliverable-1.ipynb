To understand the complexity of bin-packing, we need to know the complexity of the knapsack problem. If we know the complexity of the knapsack problem, we can then determine the complexity of bin-packing since these two problems are closely related. According to the document from Wikiwand on the knapsack problem, the complexity of the knapsack problem is NP-hard. Therefore, in our case, we can approximate the complexity of the bin-packing problem as NP-hard as well."
